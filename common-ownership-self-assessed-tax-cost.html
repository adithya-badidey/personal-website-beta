Because if the owner prices it at a higher rate than actual, they will have to pay more tax. If they price it at a lower price, someone will buy it off them at a loss to them.</p><p>To maintain investment efficiency, the tax rate should be kept low to make sure that any investment made by the owner increases his returns from selling the property. </p><p>For example:  If an owner invest 8k to increase a property value from 10k to 20k, taxed at 30%, they will have to pay 6k as tax and can be forced to sell at 20k, making them a loss of (10k+8k+6k)-20k = 4k. At 20%, its (10k+8k+4k)-20 = 2k loss. At 10%, its (10k+8K+2k)-20k = 0. Lower than 10% is good for investment efficiency in this example.</p><p>At any tax rate below the turnover rate however, the owner can price the property above the minimum they are willing to accept (all the way to infinite for 0 tax)</p><p>The claim of COST is that lowering the tax rate increases investment efficiency more than the loss of allocation efficiency. Increasing allocation efficiency and thereby lowering monopoly power has a quadratic effect on society. Even a 1% tax is good for lowering allocation efficiency while not affecting investment efficiency.</p><p>The &quot;Right to Use&quot; and &quot;Right to exclude&quot;, both pillars of private property, are transferred from the owners to the public. The higher the interest rate, the more public owns these rights.</p><p>This is radically different from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./central-planning.html">Central Planning</a> as well since the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./government.html">Government</a> doesnt set prices or allocate resources or assign people jobs. It creates a decentralized more dynamic marketplace.</p><h2 class="">Advantages</h2><ul><li>COST reduces <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./adverse-selection.html">Adverse Selection</a> or Information Assymetry by taxing signaling.</li><li>COST also effects <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./endowment-effect.html">Endowment Effect</a> </li><li>COST would lower property costs drastically</li><li>COST would remove the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./transaction-costs-of-the-market.html">transaction cost</a> of bargaining</li><li>COST will redistribute wealth to all those who play a supporting role in wealth creation but are not paid for it (like nurses, teachers, etc)</li></ul>
