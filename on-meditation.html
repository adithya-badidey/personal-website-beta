                    On Meditation
                </h1>
                <p>I am writing this as I joustle with questions for the past few weeks. Questions which have brought my previously regular meditation practice to a reckoning. Questions which have forced me to relook at some things with a new light.  Questions which demand answers, or at least an honest attempt at answering.</p><h3 class="">What is this all about?</h3><p>In my understanding, mindfulness is the practice of rooting your awarenees in the present, using an anchor of some sorts. This anchor could be a sensation (like the breathe, touch, taste, smell, sound or sight) or an action (breathing, chanting, walking) coupled with sensation or a visualization (like light or an image). Or at least, it is the practice of trying to do so. Because its not easy.</p><p>So why do we want to try to do so? Should we try to meditate or practice mindfullness at all? Why shouldn't we exist in forgetfullness? Why make it harder for oneself?</p><h3 class="">Lets think about these topics</h3><p>The awareness is a tricky subject. Most of the time, awareness doesnt exist in any percievable form. Think of a boat on an ocean, being towed by the currents. In this ocean, there are a lot of kittens. The kittens keep jumping on and off the boat. There is a person on the boat, who is just utterly obsessed with the kittens. In this image, kittens are thoughts and sensations. The boat is the body and the awareness is the person onboard. Keep in mind, we are separating the two for the sake of convinience but its all one thing.</p><p>Most of the time, the boat goes where the ocean wills, sometimes, the kittens steer it. The person is just lost in their obsession of the kittens. Sometimes, though, the person becomes aware of the boat itself; how their feet touch the boat and how the current bobs the boat. This connection of the awareness and the body is how we get started with mindfullness. Initially, this is hard. The kittens are too distracting for the person, they are unable to maintain the connection. But it gets easier the more they keep trying. This is the intent and practice of meditation.</p><p>Once they become adept at maintaining the connection to the boat itself, they can also focus on other things. Maybe something outside the boat, or even one of the kittens, without losing the focus.</p><p>Now we come to the more tricky questions, at least for me. Why do any of these things?</p><p>One reason is the one given by buddha - by not meditatng, the boat and the person (you) continue suffering - caused by attachments and fear. The kittens are not your friend, basically. By coming to this realization, and practicing meditation, you free yourself from the karmic cycle.</p><p>I have been meditating semi regularly since Feb 2019. At the time, I was going through a difficult time and a friend suggested I could try going for a Vipassana training. The Vipassana Course lasts for 10 days - each day you meditate from 4 in the morning to 9 at night with regular breaks. It happens in an isolated place (mine was in Thiruannamalai) and you're not supposed to talk/communicate for the whole 10 days. It wasnt a particularly difficult course, especially since I dont talk much anyways, I had nothing better to do and I was up for trying out new things. I actually processed a whole lot of things during the course and after those 10 days, and have continued meditation somewhat, untill recently.</p><p>In the past month or so, I have started questioning the justification of meditation and the seeming paradox of mindfulness. </p><p>One of the core tenets of vipassana is that of focus your awareness on the sensations in the body and not the sensations of the thought process. If I am meditating, sometimes, both feel the same to me. Sensations in the brain are thoughts. Thoughts in the body are sensations. Why distinguish between the two at all? There shouldn't be a duality here - but there seemingly is. And if they are the same, why not focus on the thought. </p><p>Maybe the key word is focus</p>
