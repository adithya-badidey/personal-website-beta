                <p>Strange loops are self-referencing ideas which are often paradoxes. Strange loops can be seen in the music of Bach (Cannons, and their casual cousin the Fugue, are self-referencing pieces of music). These loops can also be seen in the designs of Escher (Endless staircase and the infinite waterfall). These strange loops have been observed in maths/logic too. </p><p>Consider the <em>Epimenides paradox</em>, Epimenides was a Cretan who made this statement: "All cretans are liars". Its a paradox, if you assume true or false, the statement self-contradictory. </p><p>In set theory, we have <em>Russel's paradox</em>, which defines two kinds of sets - <em>run-of-the-mill</em> sets, like the set of walruses, and <em>self-swallowing</em> sets - set of all things except walruses, which contains the set itself too. Which category would a set of all run-of-the-mill sets fall into? Its not self swallowing - since its a set of all run-of-the-mill and if it were self-swallowing, it would have to contain itself too. Its not <em>run-of-the-mill</em>, since then it would have to contain itself (and therefore become self-swallowing). Either choice leads to a paradox.</p><p><em>Godel's incompleteness theorem</em> states that any formal system will contain paradoxes which cannot be proved or disproved using that formal system. Also, that any formal system cannot prove itself to be consistent. </p><p>Finally, there is <em>Zeno's Paradox</em>, which tries to disprove that motion (and time) itself doesn't actually exist - its created by the senses. It examines a scenario where Achilles is racing a tortoise. Since Achilles is the greatest and fastest of the greek warriors, the tortoise gets a head-start of ten metres (the unit doesnt matter). By the time Achilles has reached the ten metre mark, the tortoise has moved forward a little bit, say one metre. By the time Achilles reaches this point, the tortoise has moved forward a little bit more. And this can continue an infinite number of times. So Achilles can never catch up to the tortoise. </p>
