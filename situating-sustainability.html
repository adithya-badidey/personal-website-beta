Some of the important ones are Nature, Culture, Markets and State. The important part are that all these are in a state of change and proper interventions (even by individuals) can lead us to a better outcome.</p><h2 class="">Nature and Sustainability</h2><p><div class="tc-blog-extract">
		<h3><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./nature.html">Nature</a></h3>
		<p>Nature is what we call the ecological system we inhabit. Nature has different meanings for different people and different viewpoints. This understanding is fluid and often contradictory. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./nature.html"><em>Read more.</em></a></p>
	</div></p><p>How we understand nature and see ourselves as connected to it defines our worldview. The more in tune we are with natural cycles, the more we understand how closely our existance is linked to natural systems and how our actions effect those systems.</p><h2 class="">Culture and Sustainability</h2><p><div class="tc-blog-extract">
		<h3><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./culture.html">Culture</a></h3>
		<p>Culture is the framework of shared stories and meanings which we hold in our head about ourselves and the world around us. Culture exists in the information layer of reality and is in a state of constant flux. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./culture.html"><em>Read more.</em></a></p>
	</div></p><p>Cultural changes are key for a more sustainable future. Some things which affect cultural change are Art, Education and Government Action.</p><h2 class="">Markets and Sustainability</h2><p><div class="tc-blog-extract">
		<h3><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./markets.html">Markets</a></h3>
		<p>A market is a system/platform/etc which enables parties to engage in exchange for mutual benefit. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./markets.html"><em>Read more.</em></a></p>
	</div></p><p>We live in a society organized by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./markets.html">Markets</a>.</p><p>Historically, markets evolved with and remained within society in order to fulfill certain crucial functions - it was governed by the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./moral-economy.html">Moral Economy</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./social-norms.html">Social Norms</a>. Today, society is embedded in markets - markets define how our society is organized. What that means is that because of this, commercial activities - trading, profit, commerce are now free of social construct and taboos.</p><p>In the current market economy we often pay the cost of extraction, production and delivery of an item but not the consequences of the process, esp of non-commodities which are treated as commodities. Markets are great at dealing with things which can be priced effectively. However, <strong>Most things aren't priced with complete information</strong>, taking into account the complex interactions and the relationships it has with commons and people.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./government.html">Government</a> regulation has been one of the ways of making sure that the correct price of commons is levied on producers- <strong>Polluter Pays</strong> principle. This has been effective at locally addressing the problem. However, businesses and capital is now mobile and this leads to a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./roving-bandit-problem.html">Roving Bandit problem</a> where the entity causing the problem just shifts to another place where government regulations or enforcement is lax (esp in a global market). A company can destroy the commons of one area or state and then move to another once regulation or pollution makes it difficult to continue.</p><p>One proposed way to combat climate change is using the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./market-for-carbon-credits.html">Market for Carbon Credits</a></p><h3 class="">Markets and the 3Fs</h3><ul><li>Markets do great at addressing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./finitude.html">Finitude</a> by incentivising increased production and efficiency using price mechanism but often do so at the cost of fairness and fragility.<ul><li><div class="tc-blog-extract">

		<p>Jevon's Paradox was first proposed by William Stanley Jevons when he observed that technological improvements to coal usage efficiency lead to an overall increase in consumption of coal. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./jevon-s-paradox.html"><em>Read more.</em></a></p>
