                </h1>
                <p>The most basic type of business is a one person street-vendor business. Lets try to understand how that works - taking the example of a banana vendor.</p><p>The entrepreneur/vendor starts their day at home. They then push their pushkart all the way to the wholesale market, buy bananas, load the pushkart and then push the pushkart to their selling area. Then they hawk the bananas, exchanging the bananas for currency (with interested customers). At the end of the day, they return home and discard the remaining bananas (for simplicity's sake)</p><p>The profit for the vendor is the amount of cash at the end of the day after deducting the cost of the bananas (again, ignoring other costs like maintenance and taxes for now).</p><p>Three activities make up the aforementioned business cycle and two phenomena are observable. The three activities are procurement, logistics and sales. The two phenomena are value creation and value delivery.</p><p>Its easy to understand the three activities. Lets look closely at the two phenomena. Value creation is the transformation of something less valuable to something more valuable. In this case, the value of the product increases with its proximity to the consumer. Value delivery is the conversion of the output into currency (and everything that entails). Even though these two phenomena are distinct, its difficult to match them to the activities directly. The value creation and value delivery can happen in each of the three activities - procurement (highly skilled negotiator or finder?), logistics (highly efficient transport?) and sales (smooth talker?).</p><p>It also possible to view these activities using three structures: actors, resources and actions. There is just one actor - the entrepreneur. There are two resources (ignoring the pushkart for now):</p><ol><li>Bananas</li><li>Currency</li></ol><p>The main actions are:</p><ol><li>Travel: Home -&gt; Market</li><li>Exchange: Currency -&gt; Bananas (at wholesale rate)</li><li>Travel: Market -&gt; Streets</li><li>Exchange: Bananas -&gt; Currency (at retail rate)</li><li>Travel: Streets -&gt; Home</li></ol><p>Some points to consider:</p><ul><li>What about uncertainity?</li></ul><p>We make a big assumption about uncertainity here (that the number of sales are constant) to start off this simulation. However, this assumption is not a reasonable one since the uncertainities of everyday life make or break a business. We will look at that in the next section - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./simulating-uncertainity.html">Simulating Uncertainity</a>.</p><ul><li>Is this market at equilibrium?</li></ul><p>We have to assume it to be so. The supply-demand curve is not something that can be simulated easily. In real world situations, market forces will ensure that the vendor is selling and buying at what is the market price of the products. </p><p>If the wholesale price of the bananas rises, the vendor will have to raise the retail price in order to keep making the minimum money required for their family to survive. </p><p>If the wholesale price of bananas falls, the vendor will have to lower the price in order to stay relevant - since the entry barrier in this business is super low, others will emerge to take over their business by offering the product at the lowest possible price. </p><p>One way the vendor could beat this system is to delay the lowering of prices for just long enough to make some money but not long enough for the competitors to realize the gap in the market and rush to fill it. The vendors could, of course, form a union or syndicate to fix the prices - this will need coordination and cooperation - which has its own costs. </p>
