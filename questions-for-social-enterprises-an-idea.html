                <h2 class="">What do all NGOs/social enterprises have in common?</h2><ul><li>Their primary motive is to solve a problem in society - to create a positive change for everyone</li><li>In case of social enterprises<ul><li>They have a sustainable financial model powering them</li><li>Since they are not optimized purely for profit, they cannot be competitive in a purely competitive marketplace and therefore they need external support. This support can be drawn from philanthropic funders/grants, the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./moral-economy.html">Moral Economy</a> (a hazy community-powered marketplace regulation system) or <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./role-of-government-under-capitalism.html">Government Regulation</a>.</li><li>When talking about grants or moral economy, they have to compete against other enterprises which spend more money on marketing/virtue signalling and not be adding much value.</li></ul></li><li>In case of NGOs<ul><li>They have a model to continuously market the work they are doing to funders and get operating funds.</li><li>They have to compete with other NGOs doing similar work to be able to raise funds.</li></ul></li><li>How can a good NGO or Social Enterprise doing good work distinguish itself from others?<ul><li>The current way is using the power of their marketing/sales channels and personal connects with funders (which inspires confidence). </li><li>There are some ways to solve this problem. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./anuj-gupta.html">Anuj Gupta</a> and me have been talking about p2p review systems and transparency systems for doing this.</li></ul></li><li>On the flipside, funders cant find the right orgs to fund often - there is too much noise and not enough signal.</li></ul><h2 class="">The Idea</h2><blockquote><div>Can we make a model where the <strong>insights</strong> an organization has gathered in their domain of work becomes a signal about their authenticity?</div></blockquote><p>This would create a marketplace where orgs can share domain-specific insights and answers about questions pertaining to solving social problems. In return, they will get access to people looking for orgs/experts in specific developmental areas - this can be location based, specialization based or .</p><p>Basically, a quora/stack overflow for social orgs working in the development space in India.</p><h2 class="">One way this can work and be useful</h2><ul><li>There are many ways to categorize Social Orgs (SOs) - location is one, size is another, one is by the problems they are trying to work on (even though they might have different solutions to the same problem)<ul><li>Each SO can be listed as working under multiple problems - In particular NGOs, which cant survive by focussing on one problem, their funding needs to come for different types of projects for them to be resilient.</li><li>Once a problem becomes highly populated, it can be divided into subproblems and the SOs under that problem can be subdivided as well.</li></ul></li><li>Example:</li></ul><hr><p>The problem: How to get everyone access to cheap drinking water in Villages?
There might be a list of answers to this questions given by different SOs, which can be mapped out on a map or listed by some other category.</p><p>The answers to the above question can also lead to further questions, answers, and so on.</p><hr><h2 class="">Some thoughts about implementation</h2><ul><li>There are only so many answers to the question &quot;How to prevent violence against women&quot;. How to make sure that the first to answer the question doesnt get all the credit?<ul><li>One way is to make sure if a question is solved by many SOs, it should be divided  further into more detailed, related questions. </li></ul></li><li>There should be some minimal proof of the solution being practical</li></ul>
