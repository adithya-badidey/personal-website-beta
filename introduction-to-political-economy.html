                <p>There is a huge amount of heterogeneity in the 'developing' countries - more than the difference between the top developing countries and the developed ones, so we cant put them in the same bucket. </p><p>Here we are comparing the GDP of some countries:</p><ul><li><ul><li>GDP of US: $55,000 - Developed</li><li>GDP of Mexico: $9,000 - Developing</li><li>GDP of Kenya: $1,367 - Developing</li><li>GDP of Niger: $359 - Developing</li></ul></li></ul><p>GDP(US) : GDP(Mexico) ~= GDP(Mexico):GDP(Kenya) ~= GDP(Kenya):GDP(Niger)</p><h2 class="">What makes countries rich or poor?</h2><p>The differences between the GDP of the developed countries and developing countries has been diverging and continues to diverge.</p><p>Some hypothesises:</p><ul><li>Geography: temperature, disease burden</li><li>Human capital: education</li><li>Physical capital</li><li>Institutions: democracy, corruption, etc</li></ul><p>In many of these factors, the causality is not clear. For example: Does more education make countries richer or do rich counties improve education?</p><h2 class="">History is not deterministic</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>History is so often the product of thoughtlessness; it is the offspring of human stupidity, the fruit of benightedness, idiocy and folly. In such an instance it is enacted by people who dont know what they are doing&quot;
</p></blockquote><h2 class="">Histories persists</h2><p>History still defines the present - long, long after the face.</p><p><strong>Some examples:</strong></p><ul><li>English common laws still persist today in old british colonies</li><li>Areas of India where Indirect tax collection was prevalent are poorer than areas where direct tax collection was practiced.</li></ul><h2 class="">Economic Determinism</h2><p>Marx thinks that economic greed of capitalists will fight each other and that fight would undermine them and give power to workers. He states that Capitalism will give way to Socialism in the same way that Feudalism gave way to the current system.</p><p>Acemoglu and Robinson (2000) state that those in power, as long as they are incentived to do so, will hold on to that power and will create institutions to perpetuate their hold over power. Especially since economic and political power are mutually reinforcing.</p><h2 class="">Cultural Determinism</h2><p>Culture moves very slowly and effects human relations long after the factor that shaped the culure is gone. This makes hard changes highly unlikely - Max Weber</p><ul><li>A culture which glorifies consumption and owning of property is unlikely to change into a more conscious consumption.</li><li>Regions in africa that sent more slaves are poorer and have a lot less trust</li><li>Jews are more invested in education because historically, they were not allowed to own property while education is portableand this defined their culture.</li></ul><h2 class="">Persistence does not require determinism</h2><p>There are many things that persist due to intertia or coordination failures (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./collective-action-problems.html">Collective Action Problems</a>). This is a stated as a reason for external intervention.</p><h2 class="">Persistence does not rule out change</h2><p>Subcultural traits can persist but their environmental usefulness can change the usefulness of that trait. Institutions can persist into environments where are they are suboptimal and are supplanted by other institutions.</p><h2 class="">Bad politics create bad policies deterministically</h2><p>Acemoglu and Robinson say that this cycle cannot break without revolution. Good policies can arise only out of good politics.</p><p>One problem with this is the assuming that leaders know what are good and bad policies and are wilfully operating.</p><h2 class="">Good Institutions evolve overtime</h2><h1 class="">Points Against determinism</h1><h2 class="">Leaders can determine the course of institutions </h2><h2 class="">Institutions are not deterministic</h2><p>Institutions evolve piecemeal over time - there is no thing which emerges on its own, its a compromise between opposing views.</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="./capitalism.html">Capitalism</a> is an eample of such an institution - every single rule of ownership and regulation</li></ul><h2 class="">Small accidents can have dispropotionately large effects</h2><p>Accidents like droughts and floods can change the course of </p><h2 class="">A belief in determinism leads to inaction</h2><p>If things dont change (either for good or bad), why act at all?</p><h2 class="">Elites are not a homogenous group - they are often in conflict</h2><h2 class="">Good institutions often emerge in times of desperate need</h2><p>In times of great change, it often happens that the elites and political leaders and common men come together to create good institutions. They are a reaction to the moment.</p>
